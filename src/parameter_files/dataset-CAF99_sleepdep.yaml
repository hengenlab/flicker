#  manual_video_neural_offset_sec: 0  # No neural offset in this case, but zero must be specified due to the following issue
  # Note: In CAF99_sleepdep the SyncPulse digital recordings have a duty cycle of 480 FPS.
  #       to This was a recording error. To side step the problem the CAF77
  #       SyncPulse files were substituted in for the erroneous CAF99_sleepdep SyncPulse files.
  #       This solution works because the manual_video_neural_offset_sec is set, so the
  #       ecube time of the SyncPulse in the CAF77 file was set manually.
